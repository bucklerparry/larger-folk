Clone the repository with the big green button for whatever latest hottest changes i've pushed recently, check releases for the old beta and (eventually) big major releases with all-tested changes!

To install, go to the user folder of your computer, and navigate to 
AppData>LocalLow>Freehold Games>CavesOfQud>Mods. 
drag the larger_folk folder from the zip into the Mods folder
open up caves of qud, go to options and click modding: enable mods.
launch the game click the Mods option on the title screen, if you see larger folk appear there you've succeed, otherwise relaunch the game and check again, click enable. relaunch the game, and go to town. safe travels!
other places describe the process of installing qud mods more effectively, so search around if this doesn't work for you, i'm just some dope on a website and explaining stuff isn't my strong suit

MOD DETAILS

Right now, there are fat sprites for every player preset/calling/class, and a bunch of the creatures including almost all merchants and early game enemies.
There is a dynamic weight system, and weight effects such as breaking chairs and getting stuck in doors based on weight. Weight gain visual changes only apply to the preset characters and a (very) small amount of creatures that i added it to for testing purposes, it's kind of tedious to add it in for each creature and I want to be totally sure of the process first before i do it, in case i change how the visuals work later.
Some NPCs have new silly erotic dialogue and conversation options.
Some creatures have new descriptions reflecting their new visage.

-- Weight Gain --
dynamic weight gain can be enabled in the larger folk options at the bottom of the qud options menu!
eating food items increases your internal calories, walking around while hungry or famished burns calories. eating at a campfire does not increase calories, but as it reduces hunger it can prevent weight loss.
consuming enough calories increases your weight stage, which you'll be notified of with a popup. current weight stages are slim -> Fat -> Obese -> Immobile/Morbidly Obese (Immobility mechanics are unimplemented)
when weight gain is enabled becoming "fat" or heavier gives you the fat version of your sprite, though there are no more visual stages planned.
