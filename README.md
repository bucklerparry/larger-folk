Clone the repository for whatever latest hottest changes i've pushed recently, check releases for the old beta and (eventually) big major releases with all-tested changes!

To install, go to the user folder of your computer, and navigate to 
AppData>LocalLow>Freehold Games>CavesOfQud. 
drag the larger_folk folder from the zip into the Mods folder, if there's no "Mods" folder, create a folder called "Mods"
open up caves of qud, go to options and click modding: enable mods.
launch the game click the Mods option on the title screen, if you see larger folk appear there you've succeed, otherwise relaunch the game and check again, click enable. relaunch the game, and go to town. safe travels!
other places describe the process of installing qud mods more effectively, so search around if this doesn't work for you, i'm just some dope on a website and explaining stuff isn't my strong suit
