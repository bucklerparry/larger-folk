To install, go to the user folder of your computer, and navigate to 
AppData>LocalLow>Freehold Games>CavesOfQud. 
create a folder called "Mods", and drag the larger_folk folder into it.
open up caves of qud, click the Mods option on the title screen, if you see larger folk appear there you've succeed, click enable, and restart the game to be safe. safe travels!
other places describe the process of installing qud mods more effectively, so search around if this doesn't work for you, i'm just some dope on a website and explaining stuff isn't my strong suit
